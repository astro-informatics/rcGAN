## Notebooks

```cosmos_samples.ipynb``` For generating and plotting the COSMOS reconstruction seen in the [MMGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24197) paper. 
```kappatng_Cosmos.ipynb``` Uses the [Schrabback et al. 2010](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2010/08/aa13577-09/aa13577-09.html) shape catalogue to compute the parameters required to build a COSMOS-like training dataset.
```plot.ipynb``` To recreate the simulation figures found in the [MMGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24197) paper.
```r_vs_n.ipynb``` Calculates how the pearson correlation corresponds to the number of samples used per reconstruction.

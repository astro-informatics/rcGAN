# Generative modelling for mass-mapping with fast uncertainty quantification [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24197)

MMGAN is a novel mass-mapping method based on the regularised conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) framework by [Bendel et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13389). Designed to quickly generate approximate posterior samples of the convergence field from shear data, MMGAN offers a fully data-driven approach to mass-mapping. These posterior samples allow for the creation of detailed convergence map reconstructions with associated uncertainty maps, making MMGAN a cutting-edge tool for cosmological analysis.

# Generative modelling for mass-mapping with fast uncertainty quantification [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24197)

MMGAN is a novel mass-mapping method based on the regularised conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) framework by [Bendel et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13389). Designed to quickly generate approximate posterior samples of the convergence field from shear data, MMGAN offers a fully data-driven approach to mass-mapping. These posterior samples allow for the creation of detailed convergence map reconstructions with associated uncertainty maps, making MMGAN a cutting-edge tool for cosmological analysis.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, if in a computing cluster, first run:
``` bash
source /share/apps/anaconda/3-2022.05/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
```

To install the conda dependencies setting the correct channels:
``` bash
conda create --name cGAN --file conda_requirements.txt --channel pytorch --channel nvidia --channel conda-forge --channel defaults
```

Then activate the conda environment and install the pip requirements: 
``` bash
conda activate cGAN
pip install -r pypi_requirements.txt
```

## Reproducing our Results
### 
See ```docs/mass_mapping.md``` for detailed instructions on how to setup and reproduce the results from our paper on [MMGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24197).

Alternatively, we have provided a [zenodo file](https://zenodo.org/records/14226221) with the weights of our trained model, as well as a number of simulations.
